Write any desired [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) in the `_index.md` file.  
Avoid changing the metadata (the first few lines enclosed in `+++`) unless you wish to change the name of the page.

To upload files to this page, place them into the [static directory](/content/#static-directory).  
Any paths should be relative to the `static` directory, i.e. do not include the word `static` in the path, and start with a `/`.
