The **Fuel Cell Simulation Toolbox (OpenFCST)** is an open-source mathematical modelling package for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. OpenFCST builds on top of the open-source finite element libraries [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org/), therefore many of its requirements in terms of operating systems and such are the same as for deal.II. OpenFCST is distributed under the MIT License. OpenFCST has been developed as a modular toolbox from which you can develop your own applications. It contains a database of physical phenomena equations, fuel cell layers and materials, and kinetics mathematical models. In addition, it already contains several applications that allow you to simulate different fuel cell components. For example, you can simulate a cathode electrode (using either a macrohomogeneous or an ionomer-filled agglomerate model), an anode electrode or a complete membrane electrode assembly. The applications already provided in OpenFCST have been validated with respect to experimental data in the literature as well as numerical results from another model implemented in a commercial package.

OpenFCST is being developed at the [Energy Systems Design Laboratory](http://www.esdlab.mece.ualberta.ca/) at the University of Alberta in collaboration with the Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corp. that, together with the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada has provided the majority of the funding required to develope this code. The goal of OpenFCST is that research groups in academia and in industry use the current toolbox to better understand fuel cells and to develop new physics and material databases that can then be integrated in the current library.

OpenFCST is an integrated open-source tool for fuel cell analysis and design. It has been developed primarly using the [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org/) finite element libraries. It seamlessly integrates several open-source pre-processing, finite element and post-processing tools in order to analyze fuel cell systems. OpenFCST contains a build-in mesh generator as well as it can import quadrilateral meshes generated with the open-source pre-processor [Salome](http://www.salome-platform.org/) if your problem requires to simulate more complex geometries. The physics and material database in OpenFCST allow you to setup the governing equations for the most important physical processes that take place in a fuel cell. OpenFCST already implements the weak form for many governing equations that are finally solved using the finite element open-source libraries [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org/). In order to analyze your results, OpenFCST can output your results to .vtk files that can easily be read with the open-source post-processor [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/?). OpenFCST is not only an analysis tool. OpenFCST is also integrated with the design and optimization package [Dakota](http://dakota.sandia.gov/software.html). Therefore, it can be used for design and optimization as well as parameter estimation.
