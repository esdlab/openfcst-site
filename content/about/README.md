# Changing Home Page Slideshow Photos
Due to limitations in Hugo, the photos on the home page slideshow is located in the [/about](/content/about) directory.

All images (any format) placed in this directory will be displayed in a slideshow, in alphabetical order by file name.

# Edit About Page
Write any desired [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) in the `_index.md` file.  
Avoid changing the metadata (the first few lines enclosed in `+++`) unless you wish to change the name of the page.
