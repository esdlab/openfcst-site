# Adding Sponsors

1. In this directory, create a new subdirectory with any name.

2. Inside the new directory, create a new file named `index.md`. The file should contain the following content.

```markdown
+++
title = "<SPONSOR NAME>"
link = "<SPONSOR URL>"
+++
```

3. Inside the new directory, include exactly one image of the sponsor. The image can be named anything, and it can be any format (e.g. `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.) although I suggest finding an `.svg` file for the sponsor's logo.

> **Note**  
> Each sponsor will be displayed as a clickable image that links to the specified link. The title is used as alt text for accessibility purposes.

# Example
The [_example/ directory](_example) is an example of the correct setup.  
Copy and paste this directory and modify it if you wish.
